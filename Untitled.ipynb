    "\n",
    "Twitter is a popular online platform for expressing thoughts and opinions, and is used by a wide range of individuals, from normal citizens, to important celebrities and political figures. In particular, many US government representatives use twitter as an additional platform to express their political opinions. My goal is to be able to identify the political affiliation of a user, based on the contents of their tweet. "

    "1. Is there a difference in the way language is used by representatives of different political parties?\n",
    "2. Are certain topics discussed by representatives of different political parties more or less often?\n",
    "3. Is the sentiment associated with certain topics different depending on the user's political affiliation?"

    "Ultimately, I wish to extract a variety of features from the tweets in the datasets, most notably topics and sentiment analysis. My suspicion is that a feature composed of what topic a tweet is about, and what sentiment is expressed about said topic would indicate . Once I have done this, I intend to train a couple of classifiers in order to predict the political affiliation of a certain tweet. "
