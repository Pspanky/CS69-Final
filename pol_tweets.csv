SamsPressShop,b'I also asked Mr. Grobman why he thinks NOW is the time to tackle the problem with Social Security numbers.',Republican
SamsPressShop,"b'She skirted the question about the whether the  practice was responsible, instead stating that if a caller was uncomfortable leaving their SSN, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to do so.'",Republican
SamsPressShop,"b'I also asked Berryhill about Social Security employee voicemail practices, which tell callers to record their SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER with their name and phone number to get a return call.'",Republican
SamsPressShop,"b'She said yes, the agency has taken a number of actions including: issuing clarification policies to frontline employees, conducting national calls with managers and directors, and employing regional experts to consult w/ frontline experts at field offices on difficult cases.'",Republican
SamsPressShop,b'I asked Acting Commissioner Berryhill if the agency is taking a close look at how it handles requests for a new SSN and what it\xe2\x80\x99s doing to make sure their policies are being followed.',Republican
SamsPressShop,b'Identity theft is on the rise and we must take a hard look at the future of the Social Security number \xe2\x80\x93 both how it\xe2\x80\x99s used and if Social Security needs to do things differently.

SamsPressShop,b'We will also hear from Social Security about what it takes get a new SSN when it has been stolen and why it is often harder to do than it should be.',Republican
SamsPressShop,b'We need to break the link between identification and authentication.',Republican
SamsPressShop,"b'These numbers are valuable to identity thieves bc of how we use them: to 1) identify someone, and 2) to prove their identity.'",Republican
SamsPressShop,"b'Make no mistake, it\xe2\x80\x99s still important to limit the unnecessary use of SSNs.  But, if we want to keep pace with identity thieves, we need to think beyond just keeping them secret.'",Republican
SamsPressShop,"b'But after so many high-profile data breaches like Equifax, OPM, and Anthem, where hundreds of millions of SSNs were stolen, it is clear they aren\xe2\x80\x99t a secret anymore.  And it\xe2\x80\x99s time we stop pretending like they are.'",Republican
